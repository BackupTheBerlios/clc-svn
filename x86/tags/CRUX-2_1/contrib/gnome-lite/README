README for gnome-lite 2.10

With Gnome 2.10 the menu specifications have changed. This now requires the
setting of 2 environment variables or the making of a symlink. Gnome will run
without one of these fixes but the menus are quite underwhelming and perhaps
unuseful in that case.

The environment way: add the following lines to /etc/profile (for bash users):

	export XDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/share
	export XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/usr/etc/xdg

The symlink way:

	ln -s /usr/etc/xdg /etc/xdg
