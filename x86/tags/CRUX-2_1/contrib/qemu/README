REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL

In order to use the QEMU Accelerator Module, add the following lines to 
/etc/devfsd.conf:

LOOKUP		^kqemu$		EXECUTE /bin/mknod -m 0666 $devpath c 250 0

After this you need to load the kqemu kernel module either in 
/etc/rc.modules or manually.

Also remember to enable /dev/shm in /etc/fstab. This is the area kqemu 
uses for the virtual machine RAM.

PRECAUTION
