POST-INSTALL

Each user should execute /usr/lib/openoffice/setup
and perform a workstation installation.


IMPORTANT: THIS PORT SUCKS ;-)

1) This is a quick port, ie no bloat removed.
   I hope I'll find some time to provide a better
   port in the near future. 
   For now, it's here for your convenience.

2) This is the binary release of OpenOffice.org.
   I'm afraid a source build could take days to complete.
