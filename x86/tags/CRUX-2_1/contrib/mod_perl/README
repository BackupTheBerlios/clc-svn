README for mod_perl 2.0.0-RC6

REQUIREMENTS

  As of version 2.0.0-RC5 the mod_perl API has changed in a
  incompatible way. Read the changelog for more informations.
  Because of these changes mod_perl doesn't work together with 
  perl 5.8.6 that comes with CRUX 2.1. 
  To fix this issue install the p5-cgi port, which updates the
  CGI stuff of perl. 
  
    cd /usr/ports/contrib/p5-cgi
    pkgmk -d -i -f
