Pkgsync 1.1

Welcome to Pkgsync.  Hopefully you have read the online documentation 
at http://jaydolan.com/pkgsync.html.  While I feel that this program is 
stable and safe, it comes with no warranty.

NOTES

If you're upgrading from version 1.0 or lower, you'll need to modify
/etc/pkgsync.conf.  Beginning in version 1.1, filters are now defined
in /etc/pkgdeploy.conf as deploy_rules.  Cut and pase any filters 
you've defined to pkgdeploy.conf.  You may remove the filters variable
from /etc/pkgsync.conf.

Version 1.1 also introduces httpup integration.  See the online 
documentation mentioned above for details.
