note:

If you want to prepare zile to be used in single-user mode for
emergencies proceed like this:

    uncomment LDFLAGS=-static setting in the Pkgmk file and then pkgmk
    -kw -f.

    And then you have to reboot in single user mode. Put this at the
    bootprompt:

        linux init=/bin/sh

    And then copy the terminfo file for linux to /usr on the root
    partition.

        # mount -o remount,rw /
        # mount /usr

        # cp /usr/share/terminfo/l/linux to /etc/linux
        # umount /usr
        # mkdir -p /usr/share/terminfo/l/
        # mv /etc/linux /usr/share/terminfo/l/
        # mount -o remount,ro /

And now you can see zile work, even without /usr mounted.

If you want your .zilerc to be used while your are in single usermode
you have to copy it to /.zilerc
