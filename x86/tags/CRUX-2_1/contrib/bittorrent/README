If you installed bittorrent with wxpython you can add

  application/x-bittorrent; /usr/bin/btdownloadgui.py %s; test=test -n "$DISPLAY"

to the file ``/etc/mailcap'', and you can click and download files with bittorrent.

You may have to restart your web browser for it to start using BitTorrent.

If you're using a web browser which doesn't respect /etc/mailcap you can go into
the mimetype configuration for your web browser and manually associate
application/x-bittorrent with btdownloadgui.py (with the appropriate path, of
course.)
