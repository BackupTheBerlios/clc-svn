    Make sure kernel sources exist:

        /usr/src/linux
        OR
        /usr/src/linux-version
 
    Where linux is either source tree or link
    to your /usr/src/linux-version folder

POST-INSTALL

    To compile wpa_supplicant, you need madwifi sources
    I am still working on making this seamless...
