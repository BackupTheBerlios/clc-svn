README for mrtg 2.9.25

REQUIREMENTS

   1. Perl

   2. [Optional] Create mrtg user

POST-INSTALL

   Please read instructions at:

   All other config help can be found at:

   Here is a small edited excerpt for the impatient:

   Quick Exmaple on making a config file:

      cfgmaker --global 'WorkDir: /home/httpd/mrtg'  \
               --global 'Options[_]: bits,growright' \
               --output /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg           \
               community@router.abc.xyz

   RUNNING MRTG

   Once you have created a configuration file, try the following:

      /usr/bin/mrtg /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg
 
   This will query your router and also create your first mrtg trafic
   graphs and webpages. When you run mrtg for the first time there
   will be a lot of complaints about missing log files. Don't worry,
   this is normal for the first 2 times you start mrtg. If it keeps
   complaining after this time you might want to look into the problem.

   Starting mrtg by hand is not ideal in the long run. So when you are
   sattisfied with the results you must automate the process of running
   mrtg in regular intervals (this means every 5 minutes by default).

   You can either add mrtg to your crontab with a line like this:

      crontab -e

   Add:

      */5 * * * *  /usr/bin/mrtg <path to mrtg-cfg>/mrtg.cfg \
                       --user=root \
                       --logging /var/log/mrtg.log

   You can also run mrtg as a daemon process

      /etc/rc.d/mrtg start
  
   Note that this will only work with "RunAsDaemon: Yes" in your mrtg.cfg file.


PRECAUTION:

   1. SNMP can be a security hazard, so make sure you are familiar with
      both the protocol and the security guidelines for the devices you
      are using.
