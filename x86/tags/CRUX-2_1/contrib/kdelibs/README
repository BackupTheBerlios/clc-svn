Since KDE has way too many compilation requirements, I would like to
inform you about the PKGMK_IGNORE_FOOTPRINT variable in /etc/pkgmk.conf.
You'll probably get a bunch of .footprint mismatches during compilation
if your system differs from my build host. 

Automated builds will (hopefully ;-) not fail if you set 
PKGMK_IGNORE_FOOTPRINT="yes".

Please compile and install the required libraries & KDE packages in this
order:
