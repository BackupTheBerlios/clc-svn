REQUIREMENTS

   1. Remove Sendmail.
      Postfix and Sendmail can NOT coexist.
      You can change postfix setup to make it NOT install postfix
      compatible sendmail executable and then they could coexist.
      But this is not a supported feature of this package.
   
   2. Group "postdrop" MUST exist and _NOT_ have any users

   3. Per CRUX guidelines, user mail is used for postfix. Some
      might prefer making a postfix user. Update Post-Install
      commands to reflect your preferences.

   4. To allow people to quickly get the system running for simple
      hosts, I now include postfix.cf.example. It is a clean config
      for simple hosts that will allow you to get your box up and
      running in no time and can be tweaked as needed.
      NOTE: edit your domains, and check that you have the maps
            created (access maps, aliases, header_checks, etc.)

PRE-INSTALL

   pkgrm sendmail
   groupadd postdrop

   NOTICE: If upgrading from 1.x.x / 2.0 / 2.1 series: STOP postfix before
           update. Read notes on postfix.org website for info and
           release notes.

           AFTER upgrading from an older release DO NOT copy the old
           master.cf/main.cf files over the new files. Instead, you MUST let
           the Postfix installation procedure update the existing configuration
           files with new service entries.

           Please consult postfix release notes on Postfix website
           for further update details

POST-INSTALL

   cd /etc/postfix

   sh post-install \
       command_directory=/usr/sbin \
       config_directory=/etc/postfix \
       setgid_group=postdrop \
       mail_owner=mail \
       upgrade-package

   sh post-install \
       command_directory=/usr/sbin \
       config_directory=/etc/postfix \
       setgid_group=postdrop \
       mail_owner=mail \
       create-missing

    Rebuild hash maps:

       /usr/sbin/postalias /etc/postfix/aliases
       /usr/sbin/postmap hash:/etc/postfix/{virtual,relocated,access,transport}

    Run this only if you are using example config:

       touch regex.header-check regex.body-checks regexp.mime-header-checks
       touch access.client access.sender access.recpnt access.helo
       /usr/sbin/postmap hash:/etc/postfix/access.{client,helo,sender,recpnt}

    Note: You can ignore these warnings:

       postmap: warning: removing zero-length database file: /etc/postfix/<some-name>.db

    NOTICE: Since 2.0.10 (or so :) Postfix wants network addresses, i.e.:
            -> WRONG: 192.168.1.1/24
            -> RIGHT: 192.168.1.0/24

PRECAUTION:

   1. Building postfix with PCRE support
   
      In the future, Postfix will have a plug-in interface for adding
      map types. Until then you need to compile PCRE support into Postfix.
   
      You need the PCRE library (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions),
      which can be obtained from:
   
         ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/
   
      Postfix was tested with PCRE versions 2.8 and 3.7.
   
      In order to build Postfix with PCRE support you need to add -DHAS_PCRE
      and a -I for the PCRE include file to CCARGS, and add the path to the
      PCRE library to AUXLIBS, for example:
   
         make -f Makefile.init makefiles \
                 "CCARGS=-DHAS_PCRE -I/usr/local/include" \
                 "AUXLIBS=-L/usr/local/lib -lpcre"
   
      One CRUX example is to insert this line after "make tidy" in Pkgfile:
   
         make makefiles CCARGS="-DHAS_DB -DHAS_PCRE -I/usr/include" \
                        AUXLIBS="-L/usr/lib -ldb -lpcre"

      Same can be done for cdb instead of db:

         make makefiles CCARGS="-DHAS_CDB -DHAS_PCRE -I/usr/include" \
                        AUXLIBS="-L/usr/lib -lcdb -lpcre"

   2. Linux syslogd performance
   
      LINUX syslogd uses synchronous writes by default. Because of this,
      syslogd can actually use more system resources than Postfix.  To
      avoid such madness, disable synchronous mail logfile writes by
      editing /etc/syslog.conf and by prepending a - to the logfile name:
   
         mail.*                        -/var/log/mail.log
   
      Send a "kill -HUP" to the syslogd to make the change effective.

   3. Stopping emails with attachments/extensions

      Look at main.cf.example. Notice that it uses regexp files:

         regexp:/etc/postfix/regex.header-checks
         regexp:/etc/postfix/regex.mime-header-checks
         regexp:/etc/postfix/regex.body-checks

      These files can contain regular expressions (POSIX, to use pcre, renamed type to pcre:/file/name)
      to prevent certain matches:

         # ------ file /etc/postfix/regex.mime-header-checks ------ #
         /filename=\"?(.*)\.(bat|chm|cmd|com|do|exe|hta|jse|rm|scr|pif|vbe|vbs|vxd|xl)\"?$/
            REJECT For security reasons we reject attachments of this type "$2"
         /^\s*Content-(Disposition|Type).*name\s*=\s*"?(.+\.(lnk|asd|hlp|ocx|reg|bat|c[ho]m|cmd|exe|dll|vxd|pif|scr|hta|jse?|sh[mbs]|vb[esx]|ws[fh]|wav|mov|wmf|xl))"?\s*$/
            REJECT Attachment type not allowed. File "$2" has the unacceptable extension "$3"
         # ------ file /etc/postfix/regex.mime-header-checks ------ #

         # ------ file /etc/postfix/regex.body-checks ------ #
         /^RSLxwtYBDB6FCv8ybBcS0zp9VU5of3K4BXuwyehTM0RI9IrSjVuwP94xfn0wgOjouKWzGXHVk3qg$/
            REJECT sobig.f virus detected
         /^TVqQAAMAAAAEAAAA\/\/8AALgAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA$/
            REJECT DOS executable
         # ------ file /etc/postfix/regex.body-checks ------ #

   4. Example config: setting up HELO restrictions in /etc/postfix/access.helo

         # ------ file /etc/postfix/access.helo ------ #
         $domain               554 Liar Liar pants on Fire: (Nose is long as a telephone wire) You are not Me
         localhost             554 Liar Liar pants on Fire: (Nose is long as a telephone wire) You are not Me
         localdomain           554 Liar Liar pants on Fire: (Nose is long as a telephone wire) You are not Me
         localhost.localdomain 554 Liar Liar pants on Fire: (Nose is long as a telephone wire) You are not Me
         YOUR.IP.ADDRESS       554 Liar Liar pants on Fire: (Nose is long as a telephone wire) You are not Me
         # ------ file /etc/postfix/access.helo ------ #
