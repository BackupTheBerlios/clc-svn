REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL
1. Create user/group named with an unused id < 99:
   'groupadd -g 25 named'
   'useradd -g named -u 25 -d /var/named -s /bin/false named'
   'passwd -l named'
	    
POST-INSTALL

PRECAUTION
1. DON'T RUN BIND AS UID ROOT OR NOBODY !
2. If you need only a caching/forwarding DNS server for your
   small local network don't use bind for this. Dnsmasq is the 
   suitable program for this application. You can find a port 
   for dnsmasq under /usr/ports/contrib/dnsmasq.
