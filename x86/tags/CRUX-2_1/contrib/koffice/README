Disclaimer:

Koffice is really behind KDE3 development at this time.  Spellcheck, in
particular is severely broken.  This unsupported Koffice ports is the latest,
very lacking version available.  Known bugs include completely broken
spellcheck.  I'm keeping this port at CLC primarily for the kthesaurus program,
which I use regularly--it works flawlessly.

Recommended dependencies:

libwv2		(needed for anything resembling decent .doc support)
wordnet		(run-time dependency of kthesaurus.  It's very, very useful imho)
imagemagick (adds image support proper)

Optional dependencies:

tetex		(needed for writing of TeX documents)
			(as of koffice-1.3.3, reading TeX documents was not supported)


Here's an example of WordNet's output:
There are another NINE types of output. (many of which are closer to a "normal"
thesaurus)
