PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL

PRECAUTION

	pcre means Perl Compatible Regular Expressions. Please note that some 
	packages in 'base' and 'opt' will depend on libpcre after recompiling.

	Example: base/grep

	Assuming that you've compiled a newer version of grep.
	`./configure` said:
	..
	checking for pcre_exec in -lpcre... yes
	..
	After `pkgrm libpcre` grep will say:

	$ grep string infile
	grep: error while loading shared libraries: libpcre.so.0: cannot open _
	shared object file: No such file or directory

	'grep' will not work without libpcre, please keep that in mind.
