new command 'init': create remote pathes



Flaws:
- currently, merging only works from 'trunk/<port>'. This might be the wrong
  approach, but implies that we merge from 'base/<port>' instead of just 
  '<port>'

Issues:
- merge-from to a port which has not been merged before
- merge-from from the "wrong" architecture, e.g. last merge was done from x86


Features:
- override of merge point
- auto-guess port name
- implement diff
- make more reliable
