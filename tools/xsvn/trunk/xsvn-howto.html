    <div class="sectitle">Setup</div>
    <div class="section">

<h4>Initial checkout</h4>

<pre>$ svn co svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/clc/sparc/trunk/contrib
$ cd contrib</pre>


<h4>Prepare xsvn</h4>

<pre>$ echo "export XSVN_RELEASE=CRUX-2_1"   >  .xsvn-config
$ echo "export XSVN_BASE_URL=svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/clc" >> .xsvn-config
$ echo "export XSVN_COLLECTION=contrib" >> .xsvn-config
$ echo "export XSVN_ARCH=sparc"         >> .xsvn-config
$ echo "export XSVN_SOURCE_ARCH=x86"    >> .xsvn-config</pre>

xsvn uses those variables to understand where to merge from, and where
to release to. The last variable, <code>XSVN_SOURCE_ARCH</code>, is the
architecture you're usually merging from and will be used by xsvn to
safe you some typing. This file is simply sourced, so you can put
other stuff there too (like the <code>SVN_SSH</code> setting).
      
</div>
      
    <div class="sectitle">Working on the ports</div>
    <div class="section">


<h4>Merge a port from another architecture</h4>

<pre>$ xsvn merge-from x86/tags/CRUX-2_1/contrib someport</pre>

This will fetch the port and add it you your working copy. After that,
build, test and fix if needed, then commit:

<pre>$ svn ci someport -m "import someport to sparc/contrib"</pre>
The above assume you're in the base directory of your working copy;
if you cd'ed into the directory before to build it, you can also do:
<pre>$ svn ci -m import someport to sparc/contrib"</pre>

You can check the current status (files modified, files to be added
etc) like this:
<Pre>$ svn status</pre>


<h4>Merge without explicit merge source</h4>

Since we specified a default source architecture, xsvn can guess the
default URL (which will be the tagged version for the same release
we're in, for the architecture specified in <code>XSVN_SOURCE_ARCH</code>)

<pre>$ xsvn merge someport</pre>




Repeated merges should work just the same; to get the changes in from
x86 since the last merge, just do a 'merge-from' like shown above.


<h4>Release a port for a specific crux release</h4>

In order to run this, you must be in the base directory of your
working copy (~crux/sparc/contrib for the example above)

<pre>$ xsvn release someport</pre>

xsvn will read your .xsvn-config, and combine base url, release,
collection and architecture to the correct URL. It'll also release it
immediately


<h4>Removing a port from a release branch</h4>
To remove a previously released port, just execute:

<pre>$ xsvn drop someport</pre>


<h4>Adding a new port (not merging from another arch)</h4>

<pre>$ svn add -N myport
$ cd myport
$ svn add Pkgfile .md5sum .footprint
$ svn ci -m "add myport to sparc"</pre>

<h4>Checking which ports are in another arch, but not in ours; and the other way around</h4>

It's interesting to compare the contents of our repository against
another one. This way, it's possible to see which ports we're still
missing, or which ones we have in addition.
      
<pre>$ xsvn missing x86/tags/CRUX-2_1/contrib
$ xsvn additional x86/tags/CRUX-2_1/contrib</pre>
Note that this will consider the tagged branch
(sparc/tags/CRUX-2_1/contrib), not your working copy or trunk.
      
<p>Also note that you can omit the arguments, and xsvn will then guess the most likely case (<code>XSVN_SOURCE_ARCH</code> for the same crux release, in the same collection:</p>
<pre>$ xsvn missing
$ xsvn additional</pre>

    <div class="sectitle">Additional notes</div>
    <div class="section">

Missing features:
      <ul>
<li>diff'ing against other archs</li>
    </div>

    <div class="sectitle">Errors</div>
    <div class="section">
      <pre>Path 'svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/clc/sparc/trunk/contrib/&lt;port&gt;'</pre>: most likely, you forgot to commit and tried to release.

    </div>

    <div class="sectitle">Typical session</div>
    <div class="section">
<pre>$ cd ~/crux/sparc/contrib
$ xsvn merge tree
$ cd tree
$ fakeroot pkgmk -d # or build as root, if you prefer
$ cd ..
$ svn ci tree -m "initial commit of 'tree'"
$ xsvn release tree</pre>

Here, we first fetch the port, test it, commit it and release it to the sparc/tags/CRUX-2_1/contrib branch.
    </div>
    
    <div class="sectitle">The concept of xsvn</div>
    <div class="section">
      xsvn stores merge points as subversion properties. This way, it
      is possible to calculate the chances since the last merge
      operation. Obviously, this does not consider the fact that we
      could be merging from a different branch.
